	HIVCD:

---------------------------------------------------

1. Install MAFFT
HIVCD uses MAFFT to perform multiple sequence alignment. You can modify options
in the 'align sequences' method of cgi/upload.cgi

2. Setup Database
HIVCD assumes you have an available database where sequences are stored. In its
current state, HIVCD accesses sequences from a single table including the
sequencing date, accession number (a unique identifier for each patient sample),
and the sequence itself. 

HIVCD will need some customization to connect to and access the database. The
data source (database server name), user name, and password must be set. These
variables are set in cgi/upload.cgi and named '$data_source', '$user', and
'$pass', respectively.

3. HIVCD Password
The username and password for HIVCD must also be set in login.cgi ('$user'
and '$pass').

4. Patient data file
HIVCD depends on a patient data file to begin a run. The file contains the
accession number, patient name, and other information. HIVCD uses the accession
number to identify sequences in the database. The other information is not
essential, but HIVCD currently expects it to be present. This can be modified
under the 'Extract patient data' section of cgi/upload.cgi.

An example of the formatted file is below. HIVCD expects the run date and run
number to be on the first line of the file. Each subsequent line represents a
patient (or control), delimited by '|'. From left to right, each line contains
the following information: (1) accession number (unique to the patient);
(2) plate position; (3) patient name; (4) test name; (5) test id; (6) an
unexplained variable; (7) patient age; (8) patient sex.

<DATE>|SEQID_HIV_<RUN_NUMBER>
<ACCESSION>|1|Name, Patient|<TEST_NAME>|<TEST_ID>|<UNKNOWN>|<AGE>|<SEX>
<ACCESSION>|2|Name, Patient|<TEST_NAME>|<TEST_ID>|<UNKNOWN>|<AGE>|<SEX>
<ACCESSION>|3|Name, Patient|<TEST_NAME>|<TEST_ID>|<UNKNOWN>|<AGE>|<SEX>
<ACCESSION>|4|Name, Patient|<TEST_NAME>|<TEST_ID>|<UNKNOWN>|<AGE>|<SEX>
...
<ACCESSION>|24|Name, Patient|HIV1GENO|<TEST_ID>|<UNKNOWN>|<AGE>|<SEX>
QC-6541001|12|654 HIV Negative|1009920|55670|UNK|0|M|
QC-6541002|24|654 HIV Positive|1009920|55670|UNK|0|M|

5. Other relevant info
Any sequence containing symbols other than 'atgcurykmswbdhvn' are excluded
from analysis. This is set in cgi/upload.cgi ('$safe_sequence_character').

6. HELP!
HIVCD was developed to be used at ARUP Laboratories by Mark Ebbert and Shane
Dooley. Most of the code provided is a simple web interface to make it usable in
the clinical laboratory and it was not developed with a lot of "defensive
programming." In other words, it will not handle everything you throw at it. In
fact, if anything deviates from what has been described, it will likely blow up
(ok, not really).  I am also not an experience web programmer, so you may well
find that building your own interface will be much more favorable. All necessary
details to implement the algorithm are in our paper titled "Application of a new
informatics tool for contamination screening in the HIV sequencing laboratory".

The provided code is meant to get you started but I have inevitably forgotten
important information. Please contact Mark at mark.ebbert@aruplab.com for
assistance if you have any issues.
